# Market-Research-Tool
Data-Influence:
A platform connecting business owners/startup founders who have questions that they want to ask their target market with influencers who are ready to put up polls.

It allows you to conduct micro-surveys (single - few questions) to a larger, yet targeted audience within popular social media platforms (starting with instagrams) with the help of micro-influencers.
